    # Introduction
    The HSE Energy Management API is based on REST / Hypermedia and specified in [OpenAPI v2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). 

    The API provides energy metrics for four **Flow** types:`harvest`, `store`, `enjoy`, `grid`. 
    
    The API response consolidates all four energy flow types based on a period (week, month etc.).
    
    - Clients can use the API to manage **Energy Assets** through graphical views and by scheduling energy use at preferred times.

    - Vendor device integrations can use the API to monitor and control their **Energy Management Devices**.
    
    Energy Type | Energy Assets | Energy Management Devices
    --- | --- | ---
    `harvest` | Renewables | PV Modules, PV Grid-interactive Inverter
    `store` | Storage | Busbar Controler (BBC), Pack Management System (PMS)
    `enjoy` | Appliances | Multicore-Cable Current Sensors, Clamp-on Current Sensors
    `grid` | Mains Electricity | Smart Meters

    The API and documentation is available through the *Sundaya Developer Portal* at https://developer.sundaya.com.
