    # Introduction
    The HSE Energy Management API is REST based on [OpenAPI v2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) and specified in `yaml`.

    The API produces Hypermedia content for client applications to navigate and monitor Energy Assets, based on four energy flows.

    Type | Flow | From | To 
    --- | --- |--- | ---
    Renewables | `harvest`  | *Solar PV* | `enjoy` `store`
    Batteries | `store` | `harvest` `grid` | `enjoy`
    Appliances | `enjoy` | `harvest` `grid` `store` | *End-Users*
    Public Utility | `grid` | *Mains Electricity* | `enjoy` `store`

    Extended API documentation is available through the *Sundaya Developer Portal* at http://developer.sundaya.com. 

    ## Versions
    The API endpoint host is http://api.sundaya.com. 
    
    All requests to the API endpoint receive the latest version of the API.     
    
    Client applications may request a specific version through the `Accept` header.

        Accept: application/vnd.sundaya.v1+yaml

    # Overview
    The main request path (`hse/`) returns consolidated data for all four energy flows (*Harvest*, *Store*, *Enjoy*, *Grid*). 

    Optionally clients can filter queries (in the request *Body*) by `category`, `subcategory`, and `product-type`, to restrict data to specific energy assets. 

    ## Date-time Format
    Date and time parameters must be expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and must conform to [RFC3359](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) .

        http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/{periodID}/{finishes}

    e.g. http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/week/20190210

    The compressed version of ISO 8601 is required, without semi colons and with `T` as the time designator, as shown int he examples below.
    

    ## Timezones
    Timezones are not assumed and must be explicitly specified where API parameters allow for a timestamp to be provided. 

    The Timezone can be specified in UTC or local time as shown:

    - __UTC__, expressed with a trailing `Z` 
    
        http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/week/YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ
        e.g. http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/week/201902091830Z == 18:30 UTC

    - __Local__ time with offset 
    
        http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/week/YYYYMMDDThhmmssÂ±hhmm
        e.g. http://api.sundaya.com/hse/period/week/201902091500-0330 == 18:30 UTC
    ## Media Types
    Request `Body` parameters and all response objects are sent and received in JSON. 

    Clients should use `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers to preserve backward compatibility (in case a new media type or hypermedia scheme is introduced and designated as default).

    These media types are supported:

        application/json 
        application/vnd.collection+json
    
    ## Headers
    This following example shows a sample HTTP request and response.
    ```
    *** REQUEST ***	
    GET /hse/period/week/20190209/ HTTP/1.1	
    Host: api.sundaya.com	
    Accept: application/vnd.collection+json	
        
    *** RESPONSE ***	
    200 OK HTTP/1.1	
    Content-Type: application/vnd.collection+json	
    Content-Length: xxx	
        
    { "collection" : {...}, ... }
    ```

    ## Link-relation Types
    Link-relations in Response objects are based on [RFC8288](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8288#page-6). 

    The following registered types are referenced in the `rel` attribute of the links in an `application/vnd.collection+json` response. 
    - **self**	- Identifies the link's context.
      - In `collection.links` it identifies the collection (name = *week*)            
        - e.g. href=<a>http:/api.sundaya.com/hse/week/20190210</a>

      - In `collection.items.links` it identifies an item in the collection (name = *day*).
        - e.g. href=<a>http:/api.sundaya.com/hse/day/20190204</a>

    - **item** - Identifies child resources of the collection represented by the link's context. 
      - In `collection.links` it targets the item series whiich make up the collection (name = *week.days*).
        - e.g. href=<a>http:/api.sundaya.com/hse/day/20190204/20190210</a>

      - In `collection.items.links` it targets subitems of the item in that context (name = *day.hours*).
        - e.g. href=<a>http:/api.sundaya.com/hse/hour/201902050600/201902050500</a>

    - **up** - Identifies the parent the collection or item represented by the link's context (name = *week.month*).
        
    - **next** - Identifies the next sibling of the collection or item series represented by the link's context (name = *week.next*).

    - **prev** - Identifies the previous siblings of the collection or item series represented by the link's context (name = *week.previous*).
